# UBC Workday Hero

I created a useful chrome extension that anyone can use to get a quick overview of the course they are viewing on Workday and ease the many Workday headaches!

It provides:
ðŸ”· Average grade information from UBC Grades
ðŸ”· Average professor rating information from Rate My Professor


## How it was made
- ðŸŽ¨  Designed on Figma
- ðŸ’»  Frontend created with a simple React, JavaScript and Bootstrap UI
- ðŸ’ª  Backend created with a Python Flask 
- ðŸ§   Hosted by containerizing with Docker and deployed on AWS ECR and hosted on AWS ECS


This has been sitting in my GitHub for a while and finally finished it up for everyoneÂ toÂ use!
